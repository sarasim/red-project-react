# Project 3 - React Mars App

## Project Summary
We built a one page app with React.js that quizzes potential candidates for a Mars Mission. The project includes a welcome page, 3 timed quiz questions, result pages that could either be an "accepted" result or "rejected" result, and a 404 page. CSS animations were used on the result pages to make them more visually interesting.

## Tools Used
- React.js
- CSS animation
- Gulp, SASS, BrowserSync, Autoprefixer, Web-pack
- Git and GitHub

## Experiences
Learning how to use React.js for this particular project was quite a challenging but also very rewarding experience. While I continue to wrap my head around React.js and how to use states and props, this project was an opportunity to get more familiar with the React.js logic and process. There are apparent patterns in the code and I look forward to further unpacking React.js and work more with this library in the future.
